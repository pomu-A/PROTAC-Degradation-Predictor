However, experiments showed that XD2-149 down-regulate STAT3 level in a proteasome-independent manner. Proteomics data revealed that an E3 ligase, ZFP91, was the true substrate for this PROTAC. This paper reported a total of 22 PROTACs, which differed from each other in linker design and E3 binder choices (pomalidomide/thalidomide/lenalidomide). However, the authors didn't mention whether the remaining 21 molecules could degrade ZFP91 or not. It is also interesting that pomalidomide itself can induce the degradation of CRBN neo-substrates like ZFP91 (DC50: 0.42uM, 5-fold less potent than XD2-149), since pomalidomide can remodel CRBN surface for binding proteins like ZFP91 (Nat Med., 2019, doi: 10.1038/s41591-019-0668-z).",~ 70 nM,> 90 %
